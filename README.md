### Hi there 👋

Web developer (FrontEnd & BackEnd), with more than 2 years of professional experience and motivated, I am looking for a role as a full stack developer. I am interested in building web applications and in my short career I developed a store website for a home appliance company, and in fact, tasks that seem difficult to others give me more energy to work. 🍲🥡

I have a passion for clean code, Java, teaching, PHP, Lifeguarding and Javascript

My current side project is [Markdown Profile](https://mrlegend.gigfa.com)✌️
